Intro Application


The Intro App collects my information (names, nationality, school etc.) and displays it when the user clicks/taps "Introduce Self". The stepper adjusts the number of pets the user owns between 0(min) and 50(max). The switch indicates whether the user would like to have more pets or not. To dismiss the info alert box, the user taps the "Nice to meet you".
